Remove the "Comments are closed" text from posts.

== Description ==

On posts where comments are closed, the plugin will remove the text 'Comments are closed.' The plugin supports any languages/text domain, and will remove the text from themes and plugins.

Prerequisite: Since the plugin is [filtering gettext](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/gettext), your theme/plugin must be [localized](http://wp.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/29/internationalizing-localizing-wordpress-theme/).
